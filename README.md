# neel-plotly
A very hacky set of functions for getting plotly to do what I want when doing mech interp research, designed to be compatible with PyTorch. This is not designed to be used by other people, and as such is not documented, I'm mostly open sourcing this so I can use it when writing tutorials lol.
